This is a work-in-progress collection of structured data and scripts for Classical Studies/Classics.

The data has been compiled and organized from various online resources including:

+ the [Perseus Project](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/)
+ [Dickenson College Commentaries](http://dcc.dickinson.edu/)
+ [The Diccionario Griego-Español Project](http://dge.cchs.csic.es/index.en)
+ [L'Année philologique](http://www.annee-philologique.com/)

This is a work-in-progress collection of structured data and scripts for Classical Studies/Classics. The data has been compiled and organized from various online resources including the Perseus Project, Dickenson College Commentaries, The Diccionario Griego-Español Project, and L'Année philologique.

Currently, these are the JSON structured files:

+ DCC Greek Core Vocabulary
+ DCC Latin Core Vocabulary
+ Greek Authors
+ Greek Texts
+ Latin Texts
+ L'Année philologique Journal Abbreviations (in two forms)

There are also plain text files:

+ DGE Authors and Works
+ DGE Dictionary Abbreviations
+ Index to Smyth's Greek Grammar

Finally, there is a random collection of scripts (mostly compiled Applescripts) that I have made at various points for various uses. This section requires much cleaning up, refactoring, and organization at this stage. But I am putting them here for now nonetheless.

Hopefully, these will find some use for others.
