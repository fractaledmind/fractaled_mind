I am but a water glass,  
a container for my life.  
Life osmoses through me  
forming droplets of moments  
that ruin rivulet-like to the tabletop.

I am but a water glass,  
separating inner from outer.  
Time gloms to my edges  
condensed from the agitated infinite air around me  
evaporating as quickly as it forms.  

I am but a water glass,  
filled with molecules moving  
both thick and fast and hot  
yet lithe and smooth and cool  
a fluid resembling a solid.  

I am.
