summary: What does the phrase **Word of God** mean?
---

The **Word of God**, as a phrase, denotes 3 different things:

1. Utterances of God to a person.
    - _Unmediated_ revelation via
    - _Communication_ that is
    - _Anchored_ in time.
2. The Scriptures.
    - _Mediated_ revelation via
    - _Communication_ that is
    - _Anchored_ within a time-frame.
3. Our Lord Jesus Christ.
    - both _Unmediated_ (he existed physically on earth) and _Mediated_ (relative to us, who have not met his physical self) via
    - the _Incarnation_ and
    - is both _Timeless_ and _In-Time_.

Christ is the Perfect Word of God (complete and without error).

Scripture is _imperfect_, in the sense of incomplete. It offers a Mediated representation of Reality, but it is True.
