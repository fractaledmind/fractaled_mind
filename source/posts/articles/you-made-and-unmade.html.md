What is time? Time is commonly dissected into three parts: past, present, and future. The past is done, it is set; the future is yet to be done, it is possibility. But what of the present? The present is, in simplest form, the future being made the past. Yet if the present is nothing more than the future being made the past, why is it "the present", this thing on the same level as the past and future? Well, I think the answer is masked by the passive voice, "being made" by whom? By you. The present is the future being made the past by you.

How do you convert the future into the past? What is involved? Again, in simple form, there is you and there are outside stimuli, outside signals. There is you and not-you, which is outside of you. But the two spheres are not totally separate, as you receive many of these external signs and signals; you, via your five senses, have some connection to the not-you. And, in response to those outside signs and signals, you either act or don't act, you think, you respond. You convert the future into the past by reacting to signals from the not-you.

So, what is time? Time is the combination of the not-you things you have done, the not-you things you have yet to do, and the not-you things you are doing. Time is not-you, made and unmade, and you, making. But what is not-you without you? Nothing. Time is you, becoming; time is you, made and unmade.
