She swipes from right to left, the red square appearing and then disappearing, along with the words. Five minutes later, caught initially in my peripheral vision, the red square again.

> Why did you delete those message tonight?

> What do you mean?

> You got a couple messages, and after reading them, you deleted the thread. I'm just curious why.

> I don't know what you're talking about.

> I wasn't paying close attention, but I swear I saw the read delete and you delete the thread.

> It must have been something else. I didn't delete any message threads.

This is the first time she lies to my face and I know it. I learn she lies frequently. Past, present, and future are littered. But today is the one time I know she is lying. It's confusing more than painful. The pain comes later.

It's a double-sided pain. First, the sting; she ... lies ... to me. Subject, verb, object. She's an active force, I'm an object. And I feel like an object. Do I not warrant the truth? Am I not person enough that she can look into my eyes and tell me the lie? I am less then--I am inanimate, I am the object of her verb. After the sting comes the ache. A second pain and a different pain. Here I am the subject. I believed. Not this one time, but every other time. And even this one time, I almost believed. She doesn't lie; people don't lie. Not to your face, not to your eyes. Do eyes lie? Did the red square lie? The pain of foolishness, of naivete. It is a deep, aching pain. It hurts so deeply because it ought not to be true. I want to be that fool; I want the world to allow it. Look me in the eye and tell me the truth. Let me believe you; let me see you.

She lies. Then the sting. Now the ache.
