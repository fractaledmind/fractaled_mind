You step forward, press the button, and begin to wait. Dingy carpet in a worn-down lobby, a space almost asking you to leave it. Elevator crawls down the walls; is it fighting back? Even so, button pressed, future sealed.

Ding. It arrives. Future becomes present. Doors open. Gold and chrome and shining things. You enter. Perhaps slow at first, perhaps not. Doors close. Buttons arrayed in simple lines belie the complexity of choice. Each button a world. Present becomes future. You hesitate; or do you? Button pressed, future sealed. The elevator flies--a new floor, a better world.

Ding. Doors open. Clean carpet and soft lights, inviting. You step out. Elevator closes and returns, it's task complete.
