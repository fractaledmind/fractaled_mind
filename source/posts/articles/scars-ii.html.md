The scar is wound and healing.  

The scar is flesh and memory.  

The scar is past and present.  

We are a people of scars.  

The world is broken; broken things are sharp; sharp things cut; cuts are wounds.  

As a people of scars, we too are broken.  

Yet the scar is brokenness and wholeness.  

We are wounded, yet also knit back together.  

Know this: your scars are real. They are seen and felt. I am broken with and for you.  

But you are so much more than your wounds. You are healing, wholeness, present.  

I love you and your scars.
