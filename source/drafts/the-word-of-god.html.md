The “Word of God”, as a phrase, denotes 3 different things:

Utterances of God to a person.
This is an (A) Unmediated revelation via (B) Communication that is © Anchored in time.
The Scriptures.
This is a (A) Mediated revelation via (B) Communication that is © Anchored in a time-frame.
Our Lord Jesus Christ.
He is (A) both Unmediated (he existed physically on earth) and Mediated (relative to us, who have not met his physical self) via (B) the Incarnation and © is both Timeless and In-Time.
Christ is the Perfect Word of God (complete and without error). Scripture is Imperfect, in the sense of incomplete (cf. Soc’s critique of written discourse in the Phaedrus). It offers a Mediated representation of Reality, but it is True.
