I have entitled this website "Fractaled Mind", and in this innaugural post I want to begin to explain why. What ought the mind to do with fractals? What *are* fractals? And what the hell do they have to do with ducks and rabbits? Hopeufully, I can answer this and a few other questions as well.

To begin, let's consider precisely what a fractal is. This website's logo incorporates the infinitely intriguing [Dragon Curve fractal](!wiki). This particular fractal is generated by a relatively simple recursive procedure: Imagine a right angle isoceles triangle without its hypotenus (thus two line segments connected by a 90 degree angle); replace each line segment with another 90 degree angle (so image drawing another isoceles triangle where one of the original line segments is the hypotenus, and then removed); each subsequent replacement 90 degree angle alternates is orientation. Now, this is clearly somewhat difficult to describe, but (as they say) a picture is worth 1,000 words:

Why spend our time on these details? Well, because they help to illustrate the central defining characteristic of fractals--they are **self-similar**. As the mathematician Kenneth Falconer puts it: a fractal “contains copies of itself at many different scales.”[^Falconer 2003, xviii] This essential property can be seen quite clearly in a more fully articulated Dragon Curve:

Here, the same pattern is repeated as it tilts 45 degrees and is shrunk down.[^by a factor of &radic;2, FWIW]
