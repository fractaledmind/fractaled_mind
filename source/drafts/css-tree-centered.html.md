With each orientation now capable of being rendered in either direction, might we be able to build a tree component that could put the root node in the center of the graph and have half of the descendant graph render to left and have to the right (for the horizontal orientation) or half to the top and half to the bottom (for the vertical orientation)? We will explore this feature in the next post.
