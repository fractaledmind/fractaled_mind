Languages develop naturally. This means they develop non-rationally. As such, language can only really offer means of communication that are innately:

- vague
- redundant
- lacking relative to definitions

Deep, abstract communication, however, requires more critical, precise definitions. Here, _jargon_ enters the linguistic scene. Jargon allows for precise definitions of a discrete number of key terms which form the theoretical foundation from which deeper, abstract communication can efficiently take place. Thus, jargons will and must form within all social groups as a means of streamlining and enriching communication.

However, each individual also has his or her own _personal jargon_. We each have a discrete number of terms that are more carefully defined and/or delimited within our own mind and which play a more critical role in our foundational thinking. I believe that the degree to which _personal jargon_ plays a part in even fairly mundane communication is relatively large. Since, although personal jargon is composed of a discrete set of terms, the foundational nature of these terms suggests their frequent use in our conversations. Moreover, they need not (and likely, in many cases, will not) be overly abstract.

In order to communicate more effectively and efficiently, two or more persons must share more and more personal jargon in common. Effective communication, which allows for translation from words to concepts, necessitates that both parties have 2 sets of terms, each from their respective personal jargons, activated in their mind simultaneously.

For example, Joe and Pete are talking. As they begin, Joe has in his mind his own personal jargon (a discrete set of defined and delimited terms) as well as his conception of John’s personal jargon set. Likewise, John has his set and his idea of Joe’s set activated in his mind. So, when Joe says “epistemology is pointless,” he may have the term epistemology defined personally as “a theory of knowledge that includes the necessary and sufficient conditions of any belief being classed as knowledge-proper”. However, since Joe is talking to Pete, he must also have an assumption of what Pete defines epistemology as. By default, we would say that Joe assumes Pete to have the same definition of the term. In more nuanced communication, Joe understands that Pete is likely to have a different definition of the term. He might then pause and discuss what exactly both men mean by epistemology before he launches into his tirade that “epistemology is pointless”.

Example aside, the simple point is that each person in a communicative setting should be thought of to have at least 2 sets of definitions, his own and the others’. This is required of ALL communication. Sharing the same spoken language will ensure a modest degree of overlap, such that basic communication is accessible. However, deeper abstract communication can only occur when Joe and John’s personal jargon sets overlap to a sufficient degree, and each’s conception of the other’s personal jargon set is mostly correct.

This is the reason that it is so important to get our terms straight. We can save so much time running around the edges of concepts if we begin a conversation on more abstract things (such as theology) with a pre-discussion of our terms. Thus my interest in such distinctions as Creation vs. Formation (see this post). While arbitrary (as, I believe, all Jargon is) this distinction allows for clearer communication: God created matter; God formed Adam and (more obviously) Eve.

Over the course of these posts, I will use a small-ish number of terms and analogies that represent my personal jargon concerning theological and epistemological issues.
