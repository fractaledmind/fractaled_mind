I define Antinomies as Actual Contradictions; Paradoxes are Seeming Contradictions. In this way, I follow Kant’s jargon that defines Antinomies as the combination of a rationally-justified (and true?) Thesis along with a rationally-justified (and true?) Antithesis. If Knowledge is defined as Justified, True, Belief, such an Antinomy produces contradictory knowledge. That is, I know P and not-P.

Contrarily, a Paradox produces seeming contradiction. There is a rationally-justified (and true?) Thesis and an unjustified (and untrue?) Antithesis; however, both are believed. Thus, I believe that I know P and not-P; however, I only know P and merely believe not-P, such that I can be made to disbelieve not-P. So much for introductory definitions.

Note: I put the truth value of the propositions in question because Truth resides in the 2-D realm, whereas Justification resides in our Blurry Vision realm. I am only concerned with that third realm in this post.

I believe that Articles of Faith are best understood as Antinomies in the realm of the 2-D representation, but Paradoxes in the realm of our Blurry Vision. (Of course, in the realm of the 3-D, such binaries are void and these terms are meaningless.) By this I mean, we ought to pre-suppose that Theological propositions will be paradoxical. If we initially think that a theological position is simple and one-sided, then immediately stop and assume you are being overly simplistic. Remember, however, that the contradiction is only a seeming contradiction. We must not be brought to total epistemic cynicism.

The issue is though is that at the clear 2-D level, that seeming Paradox cannot be finally resolved. We will come face-to-face with an Antinomy. Yet this ought not to lead to epistemic cynicism, as we know that the Antinomy presupposes a binary epistemology. It is thoroughly difficult not to think in binaries, so we will likely be stuck holding “contradictory” propositions (e.g. God is One; God is Three). Yet we also know that this is not a true contradiction, because there is something beyond the 2-D realm–the 3-D reality.

Thus, in the 3-D:

Q (a single, complex proposition) simply is.
In the 2-D representation:

Q is (re-)presented as both P (a single, simple proposition) and not-P, each rationally-justified and each true (inasmuch as both are Q).
But, in the realm of our Blurry Vision:

P and not-P are a priori presupposed to be Paradoxes, such that finer and finer distinctions will allow us to think what in even the 2-D representation is unthinkable.
These divisions between the epistemic realms and distinctions of knowledge may help us to think about God more humbly and clearly.
