I am fascinated with infinities. Infinities are tricky to think about and stand at the center of many mathematical and philosophical paradoxes. I recently wrote about the non-intuitive mathematical truth that [1 = 0.9999...](). But these musings have only increased my interest in _understanding_ what we mean when we talk about an infinity.

The etymology is fairly straightforward.
>late 14c., from Old French _infinit√©_ "infinity; very large number or quantity" (13c.), from Latin _infinitatem_ (nominative _infinitas_) "boundlessness, endlessness," from _infinitus_ boundless, unlimited" (see infinite). Latin _infinitas_ was used as a loan-translation of Greek _apeiria_ "infinity," from _apeiros_ "endless."
